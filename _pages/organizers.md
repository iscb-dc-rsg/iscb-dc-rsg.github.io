> PhD Student from the Bay Area, working in the labs of Phil Bourne (NCBI/UVA) and Mike Grigg (NIAID) through the BU-NIH GPP. Eli is interested in the structural and evolutionary view of pathogen invasion in Apicomplexan parasites (e.g. Malaria and Toxoplasmosis). When he is not doing science, you can find him rock climbing or playing drums with his band Dothraki Deception.

> Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park. She is working at the [Pop Lab](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~mpop/) at the [Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/). Her current research focus is developing algorithms for assembling and comparing large, complex single genome and metagenomic assemblies. She is also interested in diversity and inclusion in STEM, especially in Latin America.

> Born and raised in northwest Ohio, followed love out to D.C., and fell into vaccine research with the National Institutes of Health. My scientific interests revolve around immunology and de novo protein design, I'm currently examining human responses to sub-dominate hemaglutinin subtypes to inform the design of a universal influenza vaccine. I also enjoy backpacking, ceramics, and pancakes.
