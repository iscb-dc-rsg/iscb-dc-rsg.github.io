# Registration
 * Deadline: TBD
 * URL: TBA

Registration is FREE, but it is required in order for us to determine how many people to accommodate for lunch. If you are not able to register by the date above, you are still welcome to come to the workshop and we will do our best to accommodate all attendees, but we cannot guarantee meals for all who do not register.

# Lunch

Lunch will be provided for all registered attendees. At least one of the options will be vegetarian. If you have other special dietary needs, please contact one of the organizers and we will make sure that there is something suitable provided.

# Venue

The workshop will take place in the Biosciences Research Building (BRB) and John S. Toll Physics buildings (PHY) at the University of Maryland, College Park campus. Registration will start at 8:30am in the physics building, outside of PHY 1412. Introduction, short research talks, and closing remarks will all take place in this location. The workshop sessions will take place in one of two locations located within several minutes walking distance (BRB 1103/PHY 1412). See the schedule section for details.

# Metro

There is a [free shuttle bus service](http://www.dots.umd.edu/schedules.html) that runs between the [College Park metro](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=79) stop on the green line and the University of Maryland campus:

* Exit from the metro station, and follow the tunnel which leads under the train tracks in the rear.
* Take the stairs up and look for signs for the 104 Shuttle immediately to your right.
* Take the bus to the Regents Parking Garage stop (the terminal stop for the bus line).
* The Physics building is located across the street, just to the right of (and connected with) the Chemistry building.

# Driving

There are metered parking spaces throughout the campus. There nearest location is the [Regents Parking Garage](https://goo.gl/maps/4ySBbiKtm7n), which is located adjacent to the Physics building, and is a 2-3 minute walk from the Biosciences Research Building. See the [UMD DOTS website](http://www.transportation.umd.edu/maps&apps.html) for more information on parking locations and rates.
